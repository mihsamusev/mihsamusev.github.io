## WORK EXPERIENCE

**Research assistant - Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark, 08/2019 – 11/2021**

Position in traffic data analysis group. Writting data processing pipelines for qualitative and quantitative traffic research. Teaching Python and SQL. Notable projects: 
- Offline LiDAR data editing and visualization program [pylidartracker](https://github.com/mihsamusev/pylidartracker) and its library version [pylidarlib](https://github.com/mihsamusev/pylidarlib) used in the master thesis by a student - _LiDAR for cyclist detection_. [See here](https://projekter.aau.dk/projekter/da/studentthesis/lidar-til-cykeldetektering(da74f7e5-656d-4d62-ac8f-4fe09523d9f0).html).
- Automated timed mailing service [easemail](https://github.com/TRG-BUILD/easemailing) for speeding intervention project EASE.
- Was responsible for teaching Python during 2 courses. Python and SQL for traffic data analysis. Microscopic traffic simulation based on [Eclipse SUMO](https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/) and Python. Materials can be found [here](https://github.com/TRG-BUILD/sumo_course/tree/master/course2021).


Last year in status of a PhD student working on intelligent traffic control in collaboration with Computer Science department at AAU. Resulted in two Python based projects. [strategoutil](https://github.com/mihsamusev/strategoutil) was developed as a Python API for the [UPPAAL Stratego](https://people.cs.aau.dk/~marius/stratego/) to enable model predictive control. (Paper in review). [sumotlslab](https://github.com/mihsamusev/sumotlslab) was an attempt to build a benchmarking environment based on SUMO for comparing traffic controllers.

**Research assistant - Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark, 08/2018 – 07/2019**

Researched computational methods in structural health monitoring. Proposed the [MATLAB toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/68988-shmtoolbox) to pipeline numerical modelling of vibrating structures, signal processing for extraction of damage sensitive features and machine learning methods for damage detection. The toolbox was used in [the paper](https://vbn.aau.dk/en/publications/a-numerical-study-of-vibration-based-scour-detection-in-offshore-) about scour detection around offshore monopiles. Co-supervised master thesis in the subjects of structural dynamics and time-series modelling.

**Laboratory technician - SINTEF Ocean, Hirtshals, Denmark, 07/ 2017 – 06/2018**

Analyzed data from load cells and camera based motion tracking system to increase the accuracy of the model testing of aquaculture cages. Developed a simulation software in C# to predict the deformation of the critical parts of the large scale fishing gear in order to assess the impact of different gear designs on by-catch reduction (See thesis below). Assisted the flume tank experiments of scaled models of industrial fishing gear.

**Structural engineer - Niras, Aarhus, Denmark, 01/2016 – 09/2017**

Was responsible for vertical load calculation for a large (23,000 m2) office building [OPS Gellerup Project](https://www.enggaard.dk/projekter/ops-gellerup-administrationsbygning/) in Aarhus, Denmark. Worked on determination of foundation sizes in the adjacent parking building and design of stabilizing walls in both buildings.
