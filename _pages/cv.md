Though trained as a structural engineer, I have always been fascinated by simulation and research software. In my career I have worked at three research institutions and developed data analysis / simulation tools across different disciplines, including structural health monitoring, transport sensor data analysis, and fishing gear simulation. My greatest strength, given how different the areas were, is my ability to learn quickly and apply new knowledge as I go. At the end of 2021, I decided to follow my passion and commit 100% to software development.

## WORK EXPERIENCE

**Software Engineer - Blue Power Partners, Aalborg, Denmark, 02/2022 - current**

Developing and maintaining the codebase to model techno-commerical evaluation of Power-to-X projects:

- Writing infrastructure code to simplify the development of plant optimization algorithms
- Developing model components for import, pre / post processing of time series (commodities, prices, intake / offtake contracts, etc)
- Mentoring colleagues on version control git and good software development practices

**Research assistant - Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark, 08/2019 – 11/2021**

Position in traffic data analysis group. Writing data processing pipelines for qualitative and quantitative traffic research. Teaching Python and SQL. Notable opensource projects:

- Offline LiDAR data editing and visualization program [pylidartracker](https://github.com/mihsamusev/pylidartracker) and its library version [pylidarlib](https://github.com/mihsamusev/pylidarlib) used in the master thesis by a student - _LiDAR for cyclist detection_ ([Report](<https://projekter.aau.dk/projekter/da/studentthesis/lidar-til-cykeldetektering(da74f7e5-656d-4d62-ac8f-4fe09523d9f0).html>)).
- Automated timed mailing and survey aggregation service [easemail](https://github.com/TRG-BUILD/easemailing) for speeding intervention project EASE.
- Was responsible for teaching Python during 2 courses. Python and SQL for traffic data analysis. Microscopic traffic simulation based on Eclipse SUMO and Python ([Course materials](https://github.com/TRG-BUILD/sumo_course/tree/master/course2021)).

Last year as a PhD student working on intelligent traffic control in collaboration with the Computer Science department at AAU. Resulted in several python tools with the most notable - [strategoutil](https://github.com/DEIS-Tools/strategoutil) - a Python API for the [UPPAAL Stratego](https://people.cs.aau.dk/~marius/stratego/) to enable model predictive control between a UPPAAL based controller and an external simulator ([Paper](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=-22B4jIAAAAJ&citation_for_view=-22B4jIAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC)).

**Research assistant - Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark, 08/2018 – 07/2019**

Researched computational methods in structural health monitoring. Proposed the [MATLAB toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/68988-shmtoolbox) to pipeline numerical modeling of vibrating structures, signal processing for extraction of damage sensitive features and machine learning methods for damage detection. The toolbox was used in [the paper](https://vbn.aau.dk/en/publications/a-numerical-study-of-vibration-based-scour-detection-in-offshore-) about scour detection around offshore monopiles. Co-supervised master thesis in the subjects of structural dynamics and time-series modeling.

**Laboratory technician - SINTEF Ocean, Hirtshals, Denmark, 07/ 2017 – 06/2018**

Analyzed data from load cells and camera based motion tracking system to increase the accuracy of the model testing of aquaculture cages. Developed the simulation tool in C# to predict the deformation of the critical parts of the large scale fishing gear in order to assess the impact of different gear designs on by-catch reduction (See thesis below). Conducted the flume tank experiments of scaled models of industrial fishing gear.

**Structural engineer - Niras, Aarhus, Denmark, 01/2016 – 09/2017**

Was responsible for vertical load calculation for a large (23,000 m2) office building [OPS Gellerup Project](https://www.enggaard.dk/projekter/ops-gellerup-administrationsbygning/) in Aarhus, Denmark. Worked on determination of foundation sizes in the adjacent parking building and design of stabilizing walls in both buildings.

## RELEVANT COURSES

**Rust Developer, 05/2022 - 10/2022**
An in depth Rust language [course](https://otus.ru/lessons/rust-developer/) to cover key features of the language, ecosystem and important libraries as well as principles of building idiomatic Rust programs. The majority of the course was spent practicing and solving 15 homeworks with a shared theme of smart home / smart device management library. An example of a homework is the [HTTP server](https://github.com/mihsamusev/otus_smart_home_backend) that lets the user populate home rooms with devices and collect their status. The course culminated in a final project where I have chosen to implement a [ray tracing library](https://github.com/mihsamusev/yarrr).

**Reinforcement Learning Specialization, 09/2020 - 10/2020**
A [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning) specialization in collaboration with Alberta University where I learn how to build and train a decision making and planning systems based on reinforcement learning. The course helped to build understanding of core RL algorithms and how they fit under the broader umbrella of machine learning.

**Deep Learning Specialization, 07/2020 - 9/2020**
Classic [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) deep learning course brought by Andrew NG and deeplearning.ai where I built the fundamentals of creating, training, tuning and testing deep learning models in TensorFlow. The course covered key architectures from the fields of computer vision and natural language processing.
