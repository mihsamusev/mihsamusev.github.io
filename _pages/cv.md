## WORK EXPERIENCE

**Research assistant - Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark, 08/2019 – 11/2021**

Position at traffic research group. Developing algorithms and software in Python and C++ for traffic measurements, object detection and tracking using camera, radar and lidar. Developed a visualization program for lidar. Was responsible for a microscopic traffic simulation course materials can be found [here](https://github.com/TRG-BUILD/sumo_course/tree/master/course2021).

**Research assistant - Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark, 08/2018 – 07/2019**

Researched computational methods in structural health monitoring. Developed a [MATLAB toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/68988-shmtoolbox) to perform numerical modelling of vibrating structures, signal processing for extraction of damage sensitive features and machine learning methods for damage detection. The toolbox was used in [the paper](https://vbn.aau.dk/en/publications/a-numerical-study-of-vibration-based-scour-detection-in-offshore-) about scour detection around offshore monopiles. Co-supervised master thesis in the subjects of structural dynamics and time-series modelling.

**Laboratory technician - SINTEF Ocean, Hirtshals, Denmark, 07/ 2017 – 06/2018**

Analyzed data from load cells and camera based motion tracking system to increase the accuracy of the model testing of aquaculture cages. Developed a simulation software in C# to predict the deformation of the critical parts of the large scale fishing gear in order to assess the impact of different gear designs on by-catch reduction. Assisted the flume tank experiments of scaled models of industrial fishing gear.

**Structural engineer - Niras, Aarhus, Denmark, 01/2016 – 09/2017**

Was responsible for vertical load calculation for a large (40,000 m2) office building and parking at [OPS Gellerup Project](https://www.enggaard.dk/projekter/ops-gellerup-administrationsbygning/) in Aarhus, Denmark. Worked on determination of foundation sizes in the adjacent parking building and design of stabilizing walls in both buildings.
