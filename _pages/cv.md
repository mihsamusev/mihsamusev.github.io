**Laboratory technician - SINTEF Ocean, Hirtshals, Denmark, 07/ 2017 – 06/2018**

Analyzed data from load cells and camera based motion tracking system to increase the accuracy of the model testing of aquaculture cages. Developed a simulation software in C# to predict the deformation of the critical parts of the large scale fishing gear in order to assess the impact of different gear designs on by-catch reduction. Assisted the flume tank experiments of scaled models of industrial fishing gear.
