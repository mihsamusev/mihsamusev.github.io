Results after 1 week of learning Rust

I always wanted to learn a low level language well. 

My current plan is to:
- Complete [the Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book) up to chater 12 to cover the basics required to be able to start writting small projects.
- Practice solving challenges using Rust on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust).
